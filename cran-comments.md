## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the size of the package to about 2 MB by adjusting the datasets used 
  in te vignette.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release), results can be obtained from (updated for 
  resubmission): https://win-builder.r-project.org/xQe4gl2nljot/00check.log
  and https://win-builder.r-project.org/RKrvaBM1K64m/00check.log
 

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There are 2 NOTEs:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: Viterbi -> This is not mis-spelled,
  it refers to the Viterbi algorithm. 
* New submission (this is my FIRST package submission)
