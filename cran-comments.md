## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the size of the package to 2,351,535 bytes by adjusting the datasets used in te vignette.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release), results can be obtained from: 
 https://win-builder.r-project.org/L1pRKBrZbPYM/00check.log and 
 https://win-builder.r-project.org/Li5uhXX3tCKc/00check.log

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There are 2 NOTEs:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: Viterbi -> This is not mis-spelled,
it refers to the Viterbi algorithm. 
* New submission (this is my FIRST submission)
