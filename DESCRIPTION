Description: An implementation of multilevel hidden Markov models using Bayesian 
    estimation in R. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a 
    generalization of the well-known hidden Markov model, tailored to 
    accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of multiple individuals 
    simultaneously. Using a multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in 
    the model parameters (transition probability matrix and conditional 
    distribution), while estimating one overall HMM. The model can be fitted on 
    multivariate data with a categorical distribution, and include individual 
    level covariates (allowing for e.g., group comparisons on model parameters).
    Parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-
    backward recursion within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The 
    package also includes various visualization options, a function to simulate 
    data, a function to obtain the most likely hidden state sequence for each 
    individual using the Viterbi algorithm.
