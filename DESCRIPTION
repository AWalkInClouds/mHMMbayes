Description: An implementation of multilevel hidden Markov models using Bayesian 
    estimation in R. It allows to simultaneously fit xx while accounting for 
    heterogeneity between subjects. It also implements multivariate HMMs (HMMs
    in which the states are determined by more than one dependent variable) and 
    covariates at the subject level, e.g., enabling group comparisons. See xxx 
    for more information, documentation and examples.
