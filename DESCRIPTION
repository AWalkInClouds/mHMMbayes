Description: An implementation of multilevel hidden Markov models using Bayesian 
    estimation in R. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a 
    generalization of the well-known hidden Markov model, tailored to accomodate 
    (intense) longitudinal data of multiple individuals simultaneously. Using a 
    multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in the model parameters 
    (transition probability matrix and conditional distribution), while 
    estimating one overall HMM. The model can be fitted on multivariate data 
    with a catagorical distribution, and include individual level covariates 
    (allowing for e.g., group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are 
    estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion 
    within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The package also contains 
    a function to simulate data.
